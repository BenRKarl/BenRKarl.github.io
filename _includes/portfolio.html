        <a href="http://afternoon-coast-5294.herokuapp.com/">Look Up!</a> shows you where the other planets in the solar system are relative to your geographical position. I pulls information from the browser and renders relative information about the planets so you can see which of the planets are currently visible to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        This app uses <span class="code">Rails</span> as a server proxy for the <a href="http://www.astronomyapi.com/">Astronomy API</a>, <span class="code">Backbone.js</span> to organize the planetary data on the client-side, and <span class="code">D3.js</span> to render the visualization.

    <div class="portfolio-element" id='coverage'>
      <p>
        <a href="http://coverage-reportr.herokuapp.com/">Coverage Reportr</a> solves a simple yet persistent problem all PR people face: coverage reporting. Typically compiling and organizing a coverage report requires lots of time in an Excel grid, but now you can create coverage reports quickly and easily!
      </p>
      <p>
        The app is built on <span class="code">Rails</span> and has four associated models. To add a hit to a coverage report the user provides an article URL, which is then parsed with <a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/">Alchemy API</a> and <a href="http://nokogiri.org/">Nokogiri</a> to extract the publication, title, author, date, and tone. Users can then share coverage reports with other users and export them to .csv format.

    <div class="portfolio-element" id="job-board">
      <p>
        General Assembly has a big job board displayed in the lobby of their main office where students, alumni and friends can share notes about various job opportunities. <a href="http://wdi-job-board.herokuapp.com/">Job Board</a> takes the old analog board and puts it online with features that make it easier for people to connect.
      </p>
      <p>
        The app uses <span class="code">OmniAuth</span> to let users log in with their LinkedIn account. The cards can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the board with the use of <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery UI</a> and we use <span class="code">Ajax</span> to save the position of the card to the database. If someone 'Likes' your card you'll recieve a notification in your profile.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also of note is that Job Board is heavily tested. Using <span class="code">RSpec</span> we currently have <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/39979/779941/4JSuPQcW4vnoWAt/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-03%20at%2010.12.13%20PM.png">over 70% test coverage</a> on our models, routes and controllers.

    <div class="portfolio-element" id='proto'>
      <p>
        <a href="http://wdiproto2014.github.io/">WDI Proto</a> is the official site for my WDI class, Proto. General Assembly's Web Development Immersive (WDI) course is an intensive, full-time, three-month-long bootcamp where students learn all there is to know about web development. WDI Proto started in April and ended in July, 2014.
      </p>
      <p>
        This app uses <span class="code">Backbone.js</span> to neatly organize information about each student into Backbone models. On the "Meet the Class" page you can see the collection view rendered as a thumbnail and each individual model view is rendered when you click on an image. Both views are rendered using <span class="code">Underscore.js</span>.

     <div class="portfolio-element" id='satellite'>
       <p>
         <a href="http://thesatellite.org/">The Satellite</a> is an experiential, photo-realistic portrait of Earth generated entirely from real-time satellite data. The project was started by Gabriel Winer, Dana Karwas and Ivan Safrin. A colleague and I, inspired by our love of science, helped Gabe and Dana rebuild and host their own custom site.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Satellite is fully responsive on all media devices and formats, utilizing programmatic style updates to adjust to screens of any width.
