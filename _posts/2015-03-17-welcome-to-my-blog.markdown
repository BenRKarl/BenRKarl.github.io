Thanks for stopping by! My name is Ben Karl, I'm a web developer living in the East Village in New York City. My blog here is mostly about web development, but from time to time you may see some stuff that interests me generally like funny internet gifs, food, Seahawks football.. things like that.

If you have any questions or simply want to say hi, head over to my contact page and feel free to reach out.

Thanks for taking the time to read my blog!
