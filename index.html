	<div class="resume"><p>Hi friend! Welcome to my website. My name is Ben Karl, and I just left my career to become a web developer. Crazy! I was in public relations for about seven years, working with companies such as Sony Playstation, PayPal, Toshiba, Intuit and, most recently, Jameson Irish Whiskey. Prior to working in PR I was an editorial intern at GamePro magazine, where I blogged for Games.net and ran a sister blog dedicated to Metal Gear Solid (nerdy, I know). When I was at GamePro I created <a id="inlinelink" href="http://youtu.be/nV5HuwIlpic">a video</a> that got pretty popular on the Internet for a few days. It's pretty embarrassing, but I still like to share it with people. If you don't know anything about Metal Gear Solid it will probably make zero sense to you since it's pretty wacky.</br></br>

	Before working at GamePro I was a student at U.C. Berkeley, where I was a sprinter on the Track and Field team. At Cal I majored in Interdisciplinary Studies and wrote two research papers on interactive media (aka video games). The first was an analysis of the game Half-Life: Counter Strike in which I argued that social media elements (such as persistent identity and reputation) could be incorporated into online video games to decrease cheating. The second was my senior thesis in which I analyzed the ways certain classic video games could be broken down to create models for accelerated learning.
	</br></br>

	I enjoy many things. I love food; New York is a beautiful place to live for anyone who likes eating a variety of different kinds of food. I like space, but like reading about it and learning about physics and the nature of the universe. I like LEGOs and building things. My dad used to teach me how to woodwork. I like a lot of other things, so click on the Contact page below and get in touch to learn more!

				Coverage Reporter is an application designed to make coverage reporting easier for the Public Relations industry. Historically compiling and organizing a coverage report required lots of time and lots of Excel, but now you can do your coverage reports quickly and easily with Coverage Reportr!

				At General Assembly there's a job board prominently displayed in the lobby of both of the main offices where students, alumni and friends can share notes about opportunities they are seeking or offering. It's very analog, so my team decided to put it online and give it a few additional features to help connect people more easily.
