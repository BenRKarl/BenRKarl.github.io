		<h3>Benjamin Richard Karl</h3>
		<h4>
			Junior-level Full Stack Web Developer || New York, NY
		</h4>
		<hr>
			<p><h3 style="text-decoration:underline;">About Me: </h3>
			I'm a self-driven, intellectually curious guy who recently set out to learn web development after a wonderful seven-year career in public relations. My time in PR provided me with a wealth of valuable experience. I can do things like manage complex projects, communicate well both internally and externally, organize pretty much anything from events to product launches; and I'm a positive, productive force as part of a close-knit fast-moving team.</br></br>

			I'm looking for an opportunity to contribute my deep professional experience and my newly earned development skills toward an organization that will enable me to continue building my skills as a programmer. I love to work hard, I love working as part of a team, and I love putting in long nights for projects that I'm passionate about, and I truly think that you would love working with me.</p>

			<a href="http://wdi-job-board.herokuapp.com/">Job Board</a>
		</h3>
		<p>
			At General Assembly there's a job board prominently displayed in the lobby of both of the main offices where students, alumni and friends can share notes about opportunities they are seeking or offering. It's very analog, so my team decided to put it online and give it a few additional features to help connect people more easily.

			<p>Here's the main job board, styled to look exactly as it appears in real life. Users can create an account with their LinkedIn account or their email address. The cards can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the board with the use of <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery UI</a> and we use Ajax to save the position of the card to the database. If someone 'Likes' your card you'll recieve a notification in your profile.</p>
