	<div class="about-me content">
			<p><h3 style="text-decoration:underline;">About Me: </h3>
			My engineering adventure started many years ago... </p>

			<p>I've been comfortably adept with technology my entire life, starting somewhere around the age of thirteen when I built my first PC to play Half-Life: Counter Strike, (a game I later studied for a graduate-level research project). In college I studied mathematics to stay close to computer science while focusing my time on athletics. I later transitioned to Interdisciplinary Studies in order to study technology from a more sociological perspective. In 2011 and 2012 I managed the development of several interactive proof-of-concept prototypes to demonstrate PayPal's new mobile payment applications to business and technology reporters.</p>

			<p>In 2014, inspired by my experience working with PayPal's engineering team, I decided to pursue my passion for technology and building things full time. Since then I've graduated from General Assembly's <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive">Web Development Immersive</a> program, where I continue to work day-in and day-out to learn everything I can about how to build web applications. My time with GA has provided me with extensive exposure to <span class="code">Ruby</span> and <span class="code">JavaScript</span>, frameworks like <span class="code">Rails</span> and <span class="code">Sinatra</span>, testing suites like <span class="code">rSpec</span>, <span class="code">MiniTest</span> and <span class="code">Jasmine</span>, as well as other tools like<span class="code">jQuery</span>, <span class="code">jQuery UI</span>, <span class="code">Backbone.js</span>, <span class="code">Node.js</span>, <span class="code">Express</span>, <span class="code">MongoDB</span>, and more.</p>

			<p>I'm extremely enthusiastic about technology and I love pouring my heart into projects that make a difference in people's lives. I think that you would love working with me, so please reach out if you have any questions, comments, or if you just want a little fantasy football advice.</p>

					<a href="http://afternoon-coast-5294.herokuapp.com/">Look Up!</a> shows you where the other planets in the solar system are relative to your geographical position. I pulls information from the browser and renders relative information about the planets so you can see which of the planets are currently visible to you.
				</p>
				<p>
					This app uses <span class="code">Rails</span> as a server proxy for the <a href="http://www.astronomyapi.com/">Astronomy API</a>, <span class="code">Backbone.js</span> to organize the planetary data on the client-side, and <span class="code">D3.js</span> to render the visualization.

				<p>
					<a href="http://coverage-reportr.herokuapp.com/">Coverage Reportr</a> solves a simple yet persistent problem all PR people face: coverage reporting. Typically compiling and organizing a coverage report requires lots of time in an Excel grid, but now you can create coverage reports quickly and easily!
				</p>
				<p>
					The app is built on <span class="code">Rails</span> and has four associated models. To add a hit to a coverage report the user provides an article URL, which is then parsed with <a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com/">Alchemy API</a> and <a href="http://nokogiri.org/">Nokogiri</a> to extract the publication, title, author, date, and tone. Users can then share coverage reports with other users and export them to .csv format.

			<div class="portfolio-element" id="job-board">
				<p>
					General Assembly has a big job board displayed in the lobby of their main office where students, alumni and friends can share notes about various job opportunities. <a href="http://wdi-job-board.herokuapp.com/">Job Board</a> takes the old analog board and puts it online with features that make it easier for people to connect.
				</p>
				<p>
					The app uses <span class="code">OmniAuth</span> to let users log in with their LinkedIn account. The cards can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the board with the use of <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery UI</a> and we use <span class="code">Ajax</span> to save the position of the card to the database. If someone 'Likes' your card you'll recieve a notification in your profile.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also of note is that Job Board is heavily tested. Using <span class="code">RSpec</span> we currently have <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/39979/779941/4JSuPQcW4vnoWAt/Screen%20Shot%202014-08-03%20at%2010.12.13%20PM.png">over 70% test coverage</a> on our models, routes and controllers.

			<div class="portfolio-element" id='proto'>
				<p>
					<a href="http://wdiproto2014.github.io/">WDI Proto</a> is the official site for my WDI class, Proto. General Assembly's Web Development Immersive (WDI) course is an intensive, full-time, three-month-long bootcamp where students learn all there is to know about web development. WDI Proto started in April and ended in July, 2014.
				</p>
				<p>
					This app uses <span class="code">Backbone.js</span> to neatly organize information about each student into Backbone models. On the "Meet the Class" page you can see the collection view rendered as a thumbnail and each individual model view is rendered when you click on an image. Both views are rendered using <span class="code">Underscore.js</span>.
