	<p class="innerblock">Hi friend! Welcome to my website. My name is Ben Karl, and I just left my career to become a web developer. Crazy! I was in public relations for about seven years, working with companies such as Sony Playstation, PayPal, Toshiba, Intuit and, most recently, Jameson Irish Whiskey. Prior to working in PR I was an editorial intern at GamePro magazine, where I blogged for Games.net and ran a sister blog dedicated to Metal Gear Solid (nerdy, I know). When I was at GamePro I created <a id="inlinelink" href="http://youtu.be/nV5HuwIlpic">a video</a> that got pretty popular on the Internet for a few days. It's pretty embarrassing, but I still like to share it with people. If you don't know anything about Metal Gear Solid it will probably make zero sense to you since it's pretty wacky.</br></br>

	Before working at GamePro I was a student at U.C. Berkeley, where I was a sprinter on the Track and Field team. At Cal I majored in Interdisciplinary Studies and wrote two research papers on interactive media (aka video games). The first was an analysis of the game Half-Life: Counter Strike in which I argued that social media elements (such as persistent identity and reputation) could be incorporated into online video games to decrease cheating. The second was my senior thesis in which I analyzed the ways certain classic video games could be broken down to create models for accelerated learning.
	</br></br>

	I enjoy many things. I love food; New York is a beautiful place to live for anyone who likes eating a variety of different kinds of food. I like space, but like reading about it and learning about physics and the nature of the universe. I like LEGOs and building things. My dad used to teach me how to woodwork. I like a lot of other things, so click on the Contact page below and get in touch to learn more!
