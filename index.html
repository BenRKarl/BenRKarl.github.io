			<p><h3 style="text-decoration:underline;">About Me: </h3>
			This year I left a seven-year career in public relations to enroll in General Assembly's <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive">Web Development Immersive</a> program, where I worked day-in and day-out from April to July to learn everything I could about how to build web applications. During that time I gained extensive exposure to <span class="code">Ruby</span> and <span class="code">JavaScript</span>, frameworks like <span class="code">Rails</span> and <span class="code">Sinatra</span>, testing suites like <span class="code">rSpec</span> and <span class="code">Jasmine</span>, as well as other tools like<span class="code">jQuery</span>, <span class="code">jQuery UI</span>, <span class="code">Backbone.js</span>, <span class="code">Node.js</span>, <span class="code">Express</span>, <span class="code">MongoDB</span>, and more.</p>

			<p>Now my engineering adventure didn't start in April. I've been incredibly adept with technology my entire life, starting somewhere around the age of fourteen when I built my first PC to play Half-Life: Counter Strike, (a game I later wrote a graduate-level research paper on). In college I pursued a major in mathematics for two-and-a-half years, later transitioning to Interdisciplinary Studies for an opportunity to study technology from a more sociological perspective. And while doing PR for PayPal I spent a year managing the production of interactive demos to convey proof-of-concept feature sets to the most prominent business and technology reporters in the U.S.</p>

			</h3>
			<p>
				Look Up is a visual representation of the positions of the planets in the solar system relative to the surface of the Earth. The app pulls user information from their browser, renders their latitude and longitude as the blue dot on the globe, then sends the information to the Astronomy API to get data about the planets, which is rendered on the globe. This app uses Rails as a server proxy for the Astronomy API, Backbone.js to organize the planetary data on the client-side, and D3.js to render the visualization.

		</h3>
		<p>
			At General Assembly there's a job board prominently displayed in the lobby of both of the main offices where students, alumni and friends can share notes about opportunities they are seeking or offering. It's very analog, so my team decided to put it online and give it a few additional features to help connect people more easily.

			<p>Here's the main job board, styled to look exactly as it appears in real life. Users can create an account with their LinkedIn account or their email address. The cards can be dragged and dropped anywhere on the board with the use of <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">jQuery UI</a> and we use Ajax to save the position of the card to the database. If someone 'Likes' your card you'll recieve a notification in your profile.</p>
