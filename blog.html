	<h2>April 20, 2014: Welcome to my blog</h2>
	<p class="innerblock">So you've found my blog... This isn't so much a formal "blog," as people tend to associate that term with all the Wordpressy, Content Management wizardry found in awesome applications like Wordpress or Tumblr. No, right here you'll find good old fashioned handmade HTML with regular English words inside.</br></br>

	I chose to do things the hard way because I am working to teach myself to program websites and like with most things you have to start somewhere. This website is like a little digital sandbox where you can watch me flail about, stumbling through the wide world of computer science.</br></br>

	New here, or don't know me personally? Well in April 2014 I left my seven-year career in public relations to become a web developer. Tomorrow (April 21) I'll be starting my first day of class in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive course, a twelve week, full time programming boot camp.</br></br>

	Stop by periodically to read about my experiences and maybe learn a thing or two. If you're considering the leap into programming I hope this space will provide you with a little enrichment, and a little encouragement to step out and take the plunge! If you have any questions about me or want to ask about my decision please reach out via my <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page.
